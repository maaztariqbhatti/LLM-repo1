Rob Hattersley, 39, runs The George in Hathersage and told Derbyshire Live how he was contacted by his opening manager last Friday (October 20) afternoon telling him to \"get down here quick\" due to floodwater seeping into the establishment during Storm Babet.\n\nRob, who is the managing director of Longbow Bars and Restaurants, says The George had experienced flooding in the past but not to this extent, and flood defences were already in place in case something like this happened. The defences, in this case, were not enough and the restaurant was quickly overcome by a thick layer of floodwater.\n\nThe George is open all year round and, like many restaurants in the county, expects a large amount of revenue in the build-up to Christmas. Due to the severe dampness that has formed since the floodwater was ejected, the building's plastering, wooden floors and various electrics have been left badly damaged.\n\nPOLL: Is the government doing enough to help with the cost of living?\n\nRob spoke to his insurance company, which told him that it expects the restaurant to be fit to open again in between four and six months' time, meaning they will miss out on thousands of pounds. Rob said: \"We're looking at an insurance payout of between £300,000 and £600,000 as a result of the repairs due to take place and the loss of business.\n\n\"I'm still going to pay my staff, of course. I'd never want them to be a victim of this flood as well as me. The main problem is that due to the lucrative insurance payout we will receive, it is very likely that we will not be insured for flood damage in the future, meaning this could only be the start of our troubles.\"\n\nThe pub had already taken hundreds of Christmas and New Year bookings that have now been rendered redundant after the damages, with the pub due to lose thousands of pounds from this alone. Rob has made it his goal to ensure that his staff are looked after as they are faced with months of uncertainty, and hopes to do so by organising wellbeing days and mental health clinic sessions.\n\nSee More: Popular Long Eaton fireworks display cancelled after flooding damages West Park\n\n\"We're looking to do all sorts for the staff. We're considering organising days out walking and five-a-side football as well as other activities where we can get together as a team,\" Rob added. He was also quick to thank the local community, buyers and suppliers for their support during this challenging time.\n\nHe added: \"We've been really grateful for all the support from the community, the amount of help we have had from staff and suppliers has been breathtaking, they've been devastated for us, and we cannot thank them enough for that.\"\n\nWe send out the biggest stories in an email every day.

For some, however, their win has proven to be a nightmare, creating a number of issues they just couldn't have foreseen.\n\nFrom a family who were left with a \"lifetime of headaches\" due to severe flooding, to a man who feared his new home would tumble off the edge of a cliff, some not-so-lucky Omaze winners have quite a few horror stories to share.\n\nThe cliff-side mansion on \"brink of collapse\"\n\nFoundry worker Glen Elmy was initially left \"gobsmacked\" after winning Stealth House - a breathtaking James Bond-style pad in Devon, complete with an infinity pool and stunning views of the ocean. His excitement quickly turned to dismay however when he learned that coastal erosion was apparently putting the five-bedroom clifftop mansion at risk.\n\nStealth House looked straight out of a Bond film\n\nJust three days after his win, however, as reported by the Mail Online, Glen, from Wallsall in the West Midlands, handed the keys to the house back to Omaze and is said to have instead asked for money equal to its £3 million value. It's understood that he hasn't set foot in Stealth House since. A source told the publication: \"I never see anybody going in or out since the win. There is all sorts of speculation that it can't be insured because of how close it's been built to the sea and on the cliff edge. There is a problem with coastal erosion all along the coast here. There are signs around the beach warning about falling rocks.\"\n\nThey continued: \"It could just be local rumours, but the person who originally built the building was told it was too close to the edge, and mortgage and insurance might be a problem. When I moved in five years ago it was on the market for £2.5 million but nobody wanted it. When the competition was running we saw cars coming and going, but soon after the winner was announced that stopped, and there's been nothing since.\"\n\nGlen became concerned when he learned about coastal erosion\n\nFamily cursed with 'lifetime of headaches' due to flooding risk\n\nA family of four were delighted when they discovered that, thanks to their Omaze win, they'd be moving into the Willowbrook House, an idyllic property nestled in Radford, a picturesque Cotswolds hamlet just six miles away from the celeb-filled town of Chipping Norton. It was only after their windfall however that local residents warned Darren Wordon and his family that their seemingly perfect property was situated in a valley that floods every single year.\n\nBack in 2021, neighbour Julia Boardman told the Mail Online: \"This valley has been flooding for hundreds of years, it is just the natural way of things. Before there was just a cottage at the side of the plot which never flooded and the water was able to flood down and drain slowly away in the stream. Then they built this horrendous house. The local council was so weak it never managed to stop it and we ended up with this house.\" In August, The Sun reported that Darren and his wife Mandy have since sold the property.\n\nThe valley is known to flood every year\n\nUnaffordable upkeep forces family to upsticks after just eight weeks\n\nA couple who won themselves an otherwise \"fantastic\" £3 million home on the Cornish coast were ultimately forced to move out after just eight weeks, as they were unable to afford the upkeep. Uttam Parmar and his wife Raki, from Leicestershire, loved the four-bedroom eco-mansion, which boasts striking views of the Camel Estuary, but decided against keeping it. Even though the property was given to them mortgage-free, with legal fees and stamp duty covered, it was still just too costly for them to live in.\n\nUttam told the Mail Online: \"It is a fantastic house in a beautiful Cornish location but the price of it comes with a price to keep it and we can't afford to.\"\n\nThe house was free but they still couldn't afford it\n\nThe house locals describe as a \"fish bowl\"\n\nA 74-year-old grandmother decided to put her Omaze home on the market after just one visit, and locals say they don't blame her as it would be like living in a \"fish bowl\". June Smith was thrilled to win the six-bedroom property in Fowey, Cornwall, back in August, with the £4.5 million house offering gorgeous views of the estuary. Although it was certainly luxurious, some locals weren't too keen on the idea of the car ferry passing by the floor-to-ceiling windows dozens of times each day and felt they'd have no privacy.\n\nLocals have described the property as a 'fish bowl'\n\nOne neighbouring resident told the Mail Online: \"You couldn't pay me to move in there, it'd be like living in a goldfish bowl. It has stunning views of Fowey and the estuary but that goes both ways. When you go across on the ferry you can see the bed and all the furniture through the windows. Plus when the big china clay ships go by they must have a fabulous view in.\"\n\nThe Mirror has reached out to Omaze for comment.\n\nDo you have a nightmare property story to share?

kicking off four days of miserable weather as communities reel from the impact of Storm Babet.\n\nThe Met Office issued a yellow warning for downpours in Scotland and Northern Ireland from midday on Friday, including areas hit by flooding last week.\n\nIn Scotland, it covers Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee, and Perth and Kinross.\n\nIt will last until at least 6pm on Saturday, and the Scottish Flood Forecast warned \"significant flooding impacts\" are likely across the next few days.\n\nHeavy rain is set to fall on areas that already have high water levels and saturated ground due to Storm Babet.\n\nAmong the worst-hit areas braced for more rain is Brechin in Angus, where hundreds of homes had to be evacuated after the River South Esk burst its banks.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf visited the town this week and pledged Scottish government funding, but warned: \"It's going to be a long road to recovery.\"\n\nCheck the five-day weather forecast where you are\n\nWarnings in place for England and Northern Ireland\n\nA separate Met Office yellow warning also covers the east coast of Northern Ireland, including Ballycastle, Larne, Donaghadee, and Newcastle.\n\nCome Saturday, another alert will extend to parts of southern and eastern England, with London, Kent, Sussex, and Essex all potentially experiencing disruption.\n\nIt is expected to remain until the end of Sunday, while the warning in Scotland will last into Monday - by then having extended south towards Stirling and Edinburgh.\n\nThe Met Office has said there is a small chance of power cuts to homes and businesses, as well as flooding, public transport disruption, and difficult driving conditions.\n\nSky News's weather presenter Kirsty McCabe said low pressure would dominate this weekend, \"bringing spells of strong winds and heavy rain that may exacerbate recent flooding and bring travel disruption\".\n\n\"Parts of eastern Scotland could get another 50 to 100mm of rain over the next few days, with as much as 150mm over the hills,\" she added.\n\n\"This isn't great news for those areas badly affected by Storm Babet last weekend, and there are still flood warnings in force.\n\n\"Elsewhere there will be heavy showers for eastern counties of Northern Ireland, southwest Wales and southeast England.\n\n\"Southern parts of England could have a very wet weekend as heavy and thundery showers merge into longer spells of rain along with gusty winds. This could prove particularly disruptive, with standing water and spray on some major roads.\"\n\nRailways braced for more disruption\n\nAhead of the rain's return, ScotRail has already suspended some services.\n\nThere will be no direct trains running between the Central Belt and Aberdeen and Inverness until Sunday.\n\nLNER has warned of delays between Edinburgh and Newcastle, while TransPennine Express and CrossCountry are operating reduced timetables.\n\nNetwork Rail Scotland warned: \"More extremely heavy rain is on the way.\n\n\"It won't be to the levels of Storm Babet, but it will affect the same areas with saturated ground.\n\n\"It will bring a risk of flooding.\"\n\nSeven people are known to have died as a result of Storm Babet, including three in
