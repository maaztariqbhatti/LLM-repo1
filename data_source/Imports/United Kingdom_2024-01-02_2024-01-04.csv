21,news-eventregistry-7916782743,2024-01-03T23:15:48Z,"Late Cork surge rains on Clare's opening parade - The Clare Champion

Holders Cork eventually possessed too much experience as they overpowered hosts Clare coming down the final straight to put one foot back in what would be a sixth successive McGrath Cup Final in Clarecastle GAA Astro on Wednesday evening. Springing five of last year's championship side from the bench in the second period, the Rebels produced a remarkable 14 point turnaround in the final 20 minutes including 1-5 from substitute duo Mark Cronin (1-3) and Chris √ìg Jones (0-2).

In contrast to eleven Cork survivors from last year's Munster Senior Championship Semi-Final showdown, a new-look Clare only possessed five of the 20 used in that memorable victory as Mark

Fitzgerald's reign finally got the mark in earnest.

Large injuries to Emmet McMahon and Mark McInerney were frustrating enough besides losing Cillian Rouine in the warm-up which ensured debuts for Darren O'Brien and Josh Guyler in addition to former Westmeath player Gavin Murray and Kildysart's Diarmuid O'Donnell. The first two-thirds of the contest were evenly-matched, with the incessant squall of rain and wind ensuring a low scoring first quarter that only saw Daniel Walsh's immediate opener eventually cancelled out by the impressive Colm O'Callaghan at 0-1 to 0-1.

Once the rain subsided, the visitors answered a Ciaran Downes free by kicking three points without reply through Paul Walsh, Darragh Cashman and a Blake Murphy free at 0-4 to 0-2. A last gasp Diarmuid O'Donnell free did halve the interval arrears to the minimum and the home side looked to kick on for the new half when returning with three further Downes frees to inch 0-6 to 0-4 clear by the 48th minute.

However, a sucker-punch Conor Corbett goal on the counter from Cork at the turn of the final quarter would by the catalyst for a complete sea-change in the narrative for the remainder as a buoyant Cork helped by their superior bench outscored their hosts by 2-10 to 0-2. Good work from captain Mattie Taylor, Brian O'Driscoll and the relentless Paul Walsh teed up Corbett for a back post flick to the net at 1-5 to 0-6 while a brace of points each from replacements Chris √ìg Jones and Mark Cronin sandwiched a clinching second goal for the latter after fellow substitutes Jones and Ian Maguire played him in.

Kieran Malone did finally end Clare's 22 minute barren patch after coming in but there was certainly no doubting the victors as Cork fleshed out the final margin in ruthless fashion. Clare meanwhile have a quick turnaround as they travel to Lemybrien on Sunday (2pm) in search of a first victory of the post-Colm Collins era before a welcome three week recess to lighten their treatment table ahead of their National League Division 3 opener at home to Sligo on Sunday, January 29.

David Beckham has expressed his sadness at the devastation caused by Storm Henk at his family's home in the Cotswolds, as winds continue to batter the UK

David Beckham has admitted he feels ""gutted"" after Storm Henk caused devastation around his family's home in the Cotswolds.

Storm Henk has brought winds of almost 100mph to the UK alongside torrential rainfall and claimed one life in the past few days. Now, hundreds of flood warnings, including 'danger to life' alerts, have been mapped across England with swathes of the country sitting underwater.

The Beckham residence has been on the receiving end too, meanwhile, with former England captain David taking to Instagram on Wednesday to share a snap of the damage. The shot showed a fallen tree on the grounds of the stunning property after it was battered by wind.

The Beckham's Cotswolds residence was impacted by Storm Henk Becks shared an image of the damage to his Instagram story

Becks, 48, captioned the image: ""Could have been worse. Still gutted."" He appeared to get over the disappointment relatively quickly, however, returning to his story to post his present from Victoria - a new coup with several chickens. Unveiling her unusual gift on Christmas Day, Posh exclaimed: ""He got some chickens!"" David could be heard saying: ""And a cockerel,"" as Victoria continued: ""Some Beckham chickens,"" and zoomed in on the birds.

She continued: ""Chickens, actually there's a massive c**k in there as well. What to get David Beckham for Christmas. They are a bit camera shy these chickens and the c**k."" Fans were left in hysterics at Victoria's comment, as one said: ""Victoria has such amazing sense of humour love it."" Another added: ""This is going to be a trending sound bite Victoria.""

It comes after Victoria shared a glimpse into her family's lavish New Year's Eve celebrations on Sunday in new family pictures. The fashion designer, 49, took to her Instagram page to post a few snaps of the Beckham family's lavish dinner at a lavish restaurant. The entire family, bar son Brooklyn Beckham and his wife Nicola Peltz were at the swanky dinner as they enjoyed glasses of wine and lit up sparklers.

In one snap, Victoria and David pulled out their best model pose on the staircase. Victoria stood behind David as she wrapped her arms around him. She looked gorgeous in a form-fitting emerald green backless dress. Her hair was straightened into a simple style and she accessorised with a pair of earrings.

David looked dapper in a navy blue suit and a pair of aviator sunglasses. Victoria also shared pictures of everyone enjoying drinks at the dinner table. Romeo's girlfriend Mimi Regan was also at the celebratory event, whilst further pics showed David and daughter Harper posing lovingly together.

60,news-eventregistry-7917529312,2024-01-03T22:14:38Z,"Hartford community activist files defamation lawsuit against lobbyist regarding North End flooding

A Hartford community activist has filed a defamation lawsuit against a lobbyist regarding the controversial sewage and flooding problems in the city's North End.

Bridgitte A. Prince, an outspoken advocate of her native Hartford who now lives in Manchester, is seeking $100,000 and representing herself in the lawsuit that stems from the decades-long problems of flooding in the Capital City.

A disabled veteran of the U.S. Army, Prince is claiming ""violation of the First Amendment, defamation, harassment, and threatening against a person with disabilities,"" according to the lawsuit filed in state Superior Court in Hartford.

Prince had been seeking to get help from the state legislature to address the sewage problems, a long-unsolved issue in the city's predominantly Black North End.

Prince states in the lawsuit that she ""demonstrated that the legislation's handling of the Hartford sewage outflow victims paled in comparison to the remedies afforded to suburban crumbling foundation victims, who were predominantly white.""

The case has been filed against Janice Flemming-Butler, a lobbyist who is the founder of Strategic Outreach Solutions, the state's only Black female lobbying firm. Flemming-Butler, who was named one of Hartford Business Journal's Top 25 Women in Business in 2022, was lobbying for the Metropolitan District Commission and the city of Hartford, according to court papers.

But Flemming-Butler is pushing back strongly with a recent motion to strike all key parts of the case, saying her comments about Prince were true.

""While defendant may have published certain statements on her Facebook page directed toward the plaintiff [Prince], nothing that she stated was false,"" according to court papers.

Through her attorney, Flemming-Butler said in a seven-page motion to strike that all counts ""should be stricken"" in their entirety by the Superior Court judge.

Among other things, Prince claims that Flemming-Butler stated, ""Bridgette Prince go back to Glastonbury and ask your legislators to fix whatever problems you having because you won't sleep messing with me.""

While they are little known outside the capital city, Prince wrote in court papers that, ""Prince and Flemming-Butler are both public figures in the Greater Hartford community.""

The standard of being a public figure in libel cases is critical because proving a case in court is more difficult against a public figure under the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in New York Times vs. Sullivan, which was decided by the nation's highest court in 1964 in favor of the newspaper.

Prince said that the two women ""often encountered each other at the CT state Capitol and the Legislative Office Building. In fact, the two were on opposite teams.""

When the flooding and sewage problems remained unresolved, House Speaker Matt Ritter of Hartford -- the most powerful player on Hartford issues in the legislature -- stepped forward to craft a compromise.

Eventually, an amendment was passed to set aside $170 million to resolve the problems, and top state officials, including Gov. Ned Lamont, gathered in June on Granby Street in the city's North End to say the resolution should not have taken so long.",,news,en,https://www.courant.com/2024/01/04/hartford-community-activist-files-defamation-lawsuit-regarding-north-end-flooding/

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Europe experienced stark weather contrasts on Wednesday, with extreme cold and snowstorms disrupting transportation and closing schools in Scandinavia while strong winds and heavy rain in western Europe caused flooding and at least one death.

Temperatures fell below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the Nordic region for a second day in a row Wednesday. In Kvikkjokk-√Örrenjarka in Swedish Lapland, the mercury dropped to minus minus 46.5, the lowest January temperature recorded in Sweden in 25 years, Sweden's TT news agency reported.

Extremely cold temperatures, snow and gale-force winds disrupted transportation throughout the Nordic region, with several bridges closed and some train and ferry services suspended. Several schools in Scandinavia were closed.

Police across most of Denmark urged motorists to avoid unnecessary trips as wind and snow battered the northern and western parts of the country.

The wave of cold air from Siberia and the Arctic region has also swept down over western Russia, with temperatures in Moscow and other areas plummeting to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 F), well below the average temperature for early January.

Officials in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other areas have issued orange weather warnings, cautioning residents against possible health risks.

Mild but wet and windy conditions prevailed further south, where a storm wreaked havoc in parts of western Europe.

In Britain, a driver died after a tree fell on his car in western England. Gloucestershire Police said the man died in the incident near the town of Kemble on Tuesday afternoon.

The storm, which has been named Henk by the official weather services of Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, has caused power cuts, transport troubles, property damage and disruption across the U.K.

More than 300 flood warnings were in place across England and Wales on Wednesday, while 10,000 homes remained without power. A severe flood alert, meaning a danger to life, was announced for the River Nene in Northampton in central England. Several residents were evacuated from houseboats and caravans at the nearby Billing Aquadrome.

The U.K.'s rail network was hit by flooding and power cuts, with many operators reporting ongoing issues for the Wednesday morning commute into work.

The strongest gales in the U.K. were recorded on the Isle of Wight, just off the coast in southern England, where wind speeds reached 94 miles per hour.

In the Netherlands, police near the city of Eindhoven said strong winds may have played a role in the death of a 75-year-old man who fell off his bicycle late Tuesday as high winds lashed much of the country. The country's water authority said a small section of a dike that regulates water levels was washed away Wednesday afternoon. The water was flowing into the already swollen river Maas near the city of Maastricht. Owners of a number of houseboats were being evacuated as a precaution.

In France, heavy rains have pummeled the northern Pas-de-Calais and Nord regions since Sunday, forcing the evacuation of about 200 people and knocking out power to 10,000 households, according to local authorities.

Roadways in the town of Blendecques turned into waterways, and authorities warned residents in the areas under flood alert Wednesday to restrict their movements until water levels subside.

Hundreds of emergency workers from around France mobilized to rescue people from inundated homes and clear roads, and reinforcements of personnel and equipment came from Czechia, Slovakia, and the already-drenched Netherlands. Powerful pumps were brought in to divert up to 60,000 cubic meters of water from the worst hit towns toward the English Channel and lower water levels around the Aa River delta, the regional prefecture said in a statement.

The national weather service maintained flood and wind warnings Thursday for several regions across northern France and its borders with Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, with more rains forecast along with winds up to 100 kph.

Parts of Germany were also grappling with flooding, which could be aggravated by more rain falling in the worst-affected northwestern state of Lower Saxony.

AUGUSTA -- As estimates of the destruction from the Dec. 18 storm continue to be tallied, officials say early damage estimates in Franklin and Oxford counties have collectively topped nearly $9 million, including more than $3 million in Rumford alone.

In Kennebec County, damage to public infrastructure has been estimated to be more than $1 million, and growing. Sean Goodwin, acting director of the Kennebec County Emergency Management Agency, said when the paperwork is filed later this month, the county estimate could reach $1.6 million.

This tally comes as representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have arrived in Maine and, with Maine Emergency Management representatives, are reviewing and validating damage assessments compiled by county emergency management staff from the powerful storm that left thousands in the dark and caused the Kennebec River to breach its banks in Somerset and Kennebec counties.

Vanessa Corson, public information officer for MEMA, said Wednesday that damage estimates for all areas in the state are not yet available.

""FEMA is in Maine this week to help validate damage numbers for public assistance and individual assistance,"" Corson said via email.

According to Rachael Leighton, secretary for the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Oxford County EMA director Allyson Hill was out in the field with FEMA officials checking the damage Wednesday. Preliminary figures exclusively for public facilities and infrastructure peg the damage at more than $5.7 million countywide.

Rumford sustained the most damage in the county, at more than $3 million of public damage. Gould Academy in Bethel, considered a private entity, had more than $1 million in damage, largely stemming from damage to a training facility at Sunday River from a mudslide.

Franklin County was also hard hit in the December storm. According to county EMA Director Amanda Simoneau, preliminary figures topped $3.09 million. Staff are working to validate the damage.

Androscoggin County officials were not able to be reached Wednesday afternoon.

If the agencies agree that the costs of addressing storm damage are more than the state can address with its own resources, Gov. Janet Mills is expected to request a major disaster declaration from President Biden that would unlock funding for restoration efforts.

Damage reports for homes and businesses -- individual assistance -- are still being compiled and will be collected throughout January.

""We have a number of requests for assistance, but that's a little harder to figure out because of homeowners' insurance and things like that,"" Goodwin said. ""MEMA and FEMA and our people are out there today doing some of those investigations now.""

Throughout the Kennebec River valley, a lot of personal damage is being tallied in the wake of the flood, as water filled parking lots, some with cars still parked in them and flooded both businesses and residences.

As emergency management officials are measuring the damage, cleanup efforts are underway, including fuel spills in Waterville, Winslow, Augusta, Hallowell and Gardiner, he said.

""We had some issues in Augusta with floating propane tanks,"" he said.

Related State announces online hub for flood relief; FEMA to assess damage

Last week, FEMA approved a request from MEMA to start a preliminary damage assessment, which is the first formal step in seeking a federal disaster declaration.

The Mills administration has set up the Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub as a central location for information, resources and help for those affected by the flood. It can be found at maine.gov/governor/mills/flood.

Staff writers Steve Sherlock and Donna Perry contributed to this report.
